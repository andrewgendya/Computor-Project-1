One way to answer this question is through the use of *barycentric coordinates*.  Given a triangle with vertices $A_1=(x_1, y_1), A_2=(x_2, y_2),$ and $A_3 = (x_3, y_3)$ and a point $P=(x, y)$ the barycentric coordinates of $P$ are $(\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\lambda_3)$ which satisfy the following two conditions.\\n\",\n",
